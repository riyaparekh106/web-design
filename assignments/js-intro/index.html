            Dogs are love-sponges when it comes to physical affection, but there
            is one point where they draw the line: hugging. Being wrapped in a
            warm embrace actually makes them feel anxious. Your dog’s favorite
            smell in the whole world is… you. And the more of your body odor on
            something, the better—as evidenced by the number of times dogs have
            embarrassingly dragged out their owner’s dirty underwear.

            Just like you love your things, dogs really like to have things that
            belong exclusively to them. This includes their food bowls, dog bed,
            and especially their toys. What about when your things suddenly
            become their things? When a dog chews up your shoe, he may be trying
            to tell you he needs more toys or attention. Dogs see the world
            through their noses and love nothing more than when we give them
            time to sniff instead of rushing on walks.

            You may think your dog can sleep anywhere, anytime, but just because
            they can sleep through a six-year-old’s birthday party doesn’t mean
            they like it, says research. And they definitely don’t like being
            awakened by a herd of said six-year-olds. In fact, startling your
            dog out of a deep sleep can make them grouchy or even aggressive.
            Most dogs are not born leaders and they do not want to be in charge
            of anything.

            Poodles…whether you love them or don’t love them yet, they’re
            certainly hard to miss. Known mostly for their curly locks and
            bright personalities, Poodles have a rich history and much more to
            offer than just their looks or their undeniable brains. Within this
            breed, you’ll see a wide variety of colorings, from solid colors
            like cafe-au-lait, black, silver, apricot, and brown to Poodles with
            a blend of colorings, including phantom and particolored Poodles.
